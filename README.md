## 🧠 About the Project

This is my **first frontend clone project** and I chose **Amazon** because:
- It has a clean yet complex UI
- It challenges HTML + CSS layouting skills
- It includes real-world features like **cart**, **login/signup**, **product listing**, etc.

What started as a curiosity… became my passion 💛  
Every `div`, every `box-shadow`, every `eventListener` is a milestone in my learning journey.

## ✨ Features

✅ Beautiful **Landing Page** (Just like Amazon!)  
✅ **Product Listing Page** with neat styling  
✅ **Add to Cart** functionality with JavaScript  
✅ **Sign In / Sign Up** forms (frontend only)  
✅ **Responsive Design** for mobile + desktop  
✅ Neat, clean folder structure and reusable code blocks  

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- `HTML5` – for building the structure  
- `CSS3` – for styling, responsiveness and layouting  
- `Vanilla JavaScript` – for DOM, cart logic, interactivity

## 💡 What I Learned

✨ HTML Semantics  
✨ CSS Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries  
✨ JS DOM Manipulation  
✨ LocalStorage logic (for cart)  
✨ How to think like a frontend engineer 👨‍💻

> **Biggest lesson**: "Code toh ban jaata hai, lekin jab tak dil se nahi likhte, wo real frontend feel nahi aata."

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Add real authentication with Firebase or backend
- ✅ Improve cart logic with quantities
- ✅ Add payment integration (just for demo)
- ✅ Deploy it with custom domain
